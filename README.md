# Event Check In
This project will be a check in and management app for vendors at events. It is intended to be a way for event organizers to know which vendors are present at an event, where they are, and their current status.

The app designed to be hosted on Azure infastructure, specifically Azure Functions, Blob Storage, and Table Storage. While the functionallity should be portable to other similar infastructure, it is not my goal to provide that port.

This app is a work in progress.
