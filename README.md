# Event Check In
This project will be a check in and management app for vendors at events. It is intended to be a way for event organizers to know which vendors are present at an event, where they are, and their current status.

The app designed to be hosted on Azure infrastructure, specifically Azure Functions, Blob Storage, and Table Storage. While the functionality should be portable to other similar infrastructure, it is not my goal to provide a port.

This app is a work in progress.

## Setup
1. Deploy the Functions in the functions folder as a new Azure Functions instance.
1. Using the storage account generated by the Azure Functions, set it to allow a statically hosted website. This may require upgrading the Account Kind to General Purpose V2.
1. Give yourself the Storage Blob Data Contributor and Storage Table Data Contributor roles in the storage account.
1. Enable system Managed Identity on the Functions instance.
1. Give the Functions identity the Storage Table Data Contributor role in the storage account.
1. Add the site folder to the $web folder in the blob storage account.
1. In the table storage account add two tables: Events and Vendors.
1. Get the site URL from the storage Static website settings.
1. In the Functions set CORS to allow the website's URL.
1. Test it out!

## Costs
With light usage this is predicted to cost me $0.08 per month, all in storage fees. (January 2025)
